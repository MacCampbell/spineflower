## Reference Genome 

How does our reference genome compare to our de novo assembly at this point?     

There is a chromosome-level assembly of Fagopyrum: GCA_002319775.1. Downloading and indexing in ~/genomes/fagopyrum     

I'll align the 187 pop gen samples to it and then see how snp numbers compare.      

Not forgetting to remove paralogs of course    


## Wayward samples

I need to find a bunch of samples that have to do with parentage.
